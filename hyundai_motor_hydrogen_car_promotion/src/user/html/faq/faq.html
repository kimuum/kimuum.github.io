From the tank, the hydrogen is transferred into the fuel cell as needed, where it undergoes a reverse electrolysis process. The fuel cell comprises two plates: a negative electrode (anode) and a positive electrode (cathode), separated by an electrolyte membrane. Hydrogen (H2) is introduced at the anode, while oxygen (O2) is supplied from the ambient air to the cathode. In an electrolyte membrane, a catalyst plays a pivotal role in the electrochemical process. It facilitates the separation of hydrogen atoms into protons and electrons. Protons can pass through the electrolyte membrane, but electrons cannot. Protons are directed toward the oxygen at the cathode, where they will meet oxygen to turn into water (H2O). As electrons are compelled through the external circuit, they produce the primary source of electricity. The electric current, generated by the fuel cell stack, powers the motor that moves the wheels. The excess electric current is utilized to recharge the battery. When additional power is required during truck operations, the battery provides an extra boost, much like the workings of a BEV. A control unit manages the interplay between the fuel cells and the battery to optimize energy usage.</p></div>"

This is because commercial vehicles tend to run a fixed route, making it easier to access hydrogen for refueling. Commercial vehicles also demand a shorter downtime compared to ordinary passenger vehicles. Refueling a hydrogen fuel cell commercial vehicle takes much less time than recharging the batteries of an electric vehicle, but fuel cells create the same range and power. Hence, fuel cell trucks and buses have emerged as successful and effective applications. Furthermore, the adoption of fuel cells extends to manned aircraft and ships. Weight plays a pivotal role in the design of both aircraft and ships. Utilizing fuel cells to reduce battery weight not only enhances performance but also frees up additional space. The application also extends to non-vehicles such as houses, factories, and cranes, where hydrogen tanks can be regularly switched out to continuously generate power without the need for a huge space for batteries.</p></div>"
