            <p>Renewable energy derives from natural resources that are self-sustainable and able to replenish themselves at a rate exceeding their utilization. 
              These natural sources are abundant and found all over the world.<br class="use-all"/><br class="use-all"/>
              In order for natural resources to be considered sources of renewable energy, they must meet two requirements.
              First, these resources should exist naturally and be consistently available. Second, they must possess 
              the ability to replenish themselves over time without causing significant pollution or environmental harm. 
              Widely known renewable energy sources are wind, water, and sunlight, which have coexisted with humanity throughout history<br class="use-all"/><br class="use-all"/>
              It is worth noting that the accessibility of renewable energy depends on factors such as location, time, and weather conditions. Nevertheless, the production and utilization of renewable energy continue to grow due to its immense potential to generate essential power, including electricity, heating, and transportation fuels.</p>

              <p><strong>Hydropower Energy: </strong>
                Hydropower draws upon the movement of water from higher to lower elevations to generate energy. There are two types of hydropower: river hydropower and reservoir hydropower. The river hydropower plants capture the energy from flowing rivers, and the reservoir hydropower plants use stored water in reservoirs for energy production. Currently, hydropower stands as the largest renewable source for electricity generation.

              <p><strong>Geothermal Energy: </strong>
                Geothermal energy comes from the utilization of thermal energy from the earth's interior. Heat sourced from geothermal reservoirs, including those deep underground, is collected and processed to generate renewable energy. Hydrothermal reservoirs, which are naturally hot and permeable, have been in operation for over a century and are widely regarded as dependable sources of geothermal energy.
